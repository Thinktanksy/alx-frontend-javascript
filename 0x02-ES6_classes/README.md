## Project Overview

Welcome to the 0x02-ES6_classes project! This project focuses on exploring ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) classes in JavaScript, providing an in-depth understanding of object-oriented programming principles and ES6 class features.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files and directories:

- `0-main.js`: Entry point for the project.
- `0-classroom.js`: Initial class definition for a classroom.
- `1-main.js`: Demonstrates creating and using instances of the `Classroom` class.
- `1-make_classrooms.js`: A script for creating multiple `Classroom` instances.
- `2-main.js`: Introduces the concept of inheritance using a base class `HolbertonCourse` and its subclasses.
- `2-hbtn_course.js`: Class definitions for `HolbertonCourse` and its subclasses.
- `3-main.js`: Demonstrates inheritance and method overriding with `Pricing` and `Euro` classes.
- `3-currency.js`: Class definitions for `Currency` and `Euro`.
- `4-main.js`: Illustrates the use of getter and setter methods with the `Pricing` class.
- `4-pricing.js`: Class definition for `Pricing`.
- `5-main.js`: Introduces static methods with the `Building` class.
- `5-building.js`: Class definition for `Building`.
- `6-main.js`: Showcases the use of `super()` in class constructors with the `SkyHighBuilding` class.
- `6-sky_high.js`: Class definition for `SkyHighBuilding`.
- `7-main.js`: Demonstrates `extends` and `super()` with the `Airport` class.
- `7-airport.js`: Class definition for `Airport`.
- `8-main.js`: Explores classes as functions with `HbtnClass`.
- `8-hbtn_class.js`: Class definition for `HbtnClass`.
- `9-main.js`: Covers the concept of hoisting with a simple example.
- `9-hoisting.js`: JavaScript code for demonstrating hoisting behavior.
- `10-main.js`: Provides an example of a car class and its usage.
- `10-car.js`: Class definition for `Car`.
